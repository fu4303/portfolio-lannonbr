Every year, DigitalOcean puts on Hacktoberfest, a celebration of the Open Source community. If you submit 4 PRs across any repository on GitHub, you will win a custom t-shirt for your effort in contributing to the open source community. If you wish to participate, sign up on the Hacktoberfest site: [hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

## Available projects to contribute

There are countless repos you can contribute to, and with that, I have a few that I have issues open and available for Hacktoberfest:

- [gatsby-theme-github-stats](https://github.com/lannonbr/gatsby-theme-github-stats/): A Gatsby theme to display github statistics on a dashboard.
- [puppeteer-screenshot-action](https://github.com/lannonbr/puppeteer-screenshot-action/): A GitHub Action for taking screenshots of webpages using Puppeteer.

If you see an issue that has the Hacktoberfest label and it is not assigned to someone yet, it is up for grabs.

I've been participating for the past few years and it's always a pleasure to give back to the community, but also in recent years, be able to give the opportunity for someone's first pull request to a project. It's going to be an exciting month and I can't wait to see what is in store.
