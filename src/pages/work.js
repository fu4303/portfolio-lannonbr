        <p>
          I am currently employed as a web developer and I am always learning
          new technologies and building new things. As a developer, I strive to
          create products and solutions that can empower other developers.

        <p>
          As well, I have a site which I list development resources that I
          personally use or recommend:{' '}

    <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
    <p>
      I am an active member of the Syracuse Developer community and go to events
      such as Open Hack and the Syracue JS meetup. It's a place that I've found
      local dev opportunities and a place to help out / get answers in the tech
      community. You can find out more at{' '}
      <a href="https://syracuse.io">Syracuse.io</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well, I am heavily active on GitHub. If you want to learn more about my
      open source work, head over to the{' '}
      <Link to="/opensource/">Open Source Page</Link> or my{' '}
      <a href="https://github.com/lannonbr">Github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I've found a haven inÂ the Twitch Dev community of individuals
      livestreaming and learning with others. I am a part of the{' '}
      <a href="https://livecoders.dev">LiveCoders</a> team and stream weekly
      working on various projects live. I partake in discussions with other
      streamers and community members in the stream chatrooms and getting
      involved with projects they're building and putting up on GitHub. You can
      learn more about my stream on the <Link to="/stream/">Stream Page</Link>.
