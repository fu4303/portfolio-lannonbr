# Portfolio

![](https://github.com/lannonbr/Portfolio/workflows/Daily%20Build/badge.svg)

This is the current iteration of my personal portfolio site as of early 2019.

The site is developed in Gatsby.

## What's involved

- MDX
- TailwindCSS
- React-feather
- Date-fns

## Other Tidbits

The site is deployed on Netlify. Either any time a commit is pushed to the `master` branch or at 12am every day, the site will be rebuilt and redeployed.
