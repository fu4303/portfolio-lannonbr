This is going to be notes for myself for the book [Working In Public](https://press.stripe.com/#working-in-public). The contents and thoughts on this page are mine on the topic unless it is a direct quote from the book.

## Introduction

- How can open source be sustainable, both financially and emotionally.
- what does it mean to create a community open to contributors and how can you retain those community members to contribute more?

> Open source code is public, but it doesn't have to be participatory. ~ Nadia (page 9)

This hits hard at home for many communities I've been a part of where there may be hundreds or thousands of people who "contribute" but active contribution is a much lower number.

> This distribution-where one or a few developers do most of the work, followed by a long tail of casual contributors, and many more passive users-is now the norm, not the exception, in Open Source. ~ Nadia (page 10)

Nadia is bringing up the developer ecosystem is becoming modularized, away from the monolithic structure of the past.

> ...These developers aren't building communities; they're directing air traffic ~ Nadia (page 13)

Nadia's commenting the maintainers have to balance the seesaw between making progress of their projects and the swath of people learning about said tool / needing help. The price of maintainers is their time.

They (users) at screaming at you, not for you for your time.

Open source was supposed to be collaborative, but it's become far from it.

### Thoughts on Introduction

Open Source in many instances is this one-to-many scenario where you can think at least in the web developer community, Kent C Dodds is synonomous with Testing, Dan Abramov is synonomous with React, and it goes to that even though there are tons of people making and creating things, we've entered a "consumption" world where there's always more users than creators.

Open Source touts "Oh anyone can submit issues or code contributions" but how accurate is that and how does that affect both someone coming into Open Source as well as the people managing the projects?

## Part 1 - How People Make: 01 - GitHub as a Platform

Git as a tool is relatively new in comparison to other version control systems (Created in 2005). Beforehand were centralized systems.

Origins of FOSS were in terms of free access to code, less about free in terms of cost. Brought forward through the 80s hacker culture.

Three pioneers in the day:

- Richard Stallman: Founder of the Free Software movement & GNU Project
- Eric S. Raymond: Writer of "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
- Linus Torvalds: Creator of the Linux Kernel

Open source doesn't have a possesive sense (Which for particular projects I feel may be actually the opposite).

Permissive vs Copyleft licenses can arise to issues in the commercial space.

> "they (OSS devs) prioritize _convienence_ over freedom" ~ Nadia (page 30)

People care about the workflow more rather than having access to the source code of the cloud service. This reminds me of the debate of do you want something very custom, or something that works and lets you quickly solve your issues.

> Software licenses regulate _distribution_, but cannot _regulate_ production... ~ Steve Klabnik (page 33)

> "Coding became like tweeting" ~ Nadia (page 34)

I find it interesting Nadia introduces NPM as JavaScript's package manager on page 36, as it has become the defacto for frontend, backend, ui, etc, that is involved with JS. no longer just for node.

The big JS devs are known for the people they are, not the tools they build.

Funny enough, I wrote about Dan & Kent above and of course Nadia is bringing this up directly now.

## Thoughts on GitHub as a Platform

GitHub really transitioned "Open Source" to be a public space for people to contribute to software, rather than the traditional sense of it being a licensing / distribution tool. With GitHub exploding in popularity, it became a social network for devs, and with such, the cliques form, the celebs rise and fall, and the things we thought were stable may not be anymore.
