This is going to be notes for myself for the book [Working In Public](https://press.stripe.com/#working-in-public). The contents and thoughts on this page are mine on the topic unless it is a direct quote from the book.

## Introduction

- How can open source be sustainable, both financially and emotionally.
- what does it mean to create a community open to contributors and how can you retain those community members to contribute more?

> Open source code is public, but it doesn't have to be participatory. ~ Nadia (page 9)

This hits hard at home for many communities I've been a part of where there may be hundreds or thousands of people who "contribute" but active contribution is a much lower number.

> This distribution-where one or a few developers do most of the work, followed by a long tail of casual contributors, and many more passive users-is now the norm, not the exception, in Open Source. ~ Nadia (page 10)

Nadia is bringing up the developer ecosystem is becoming modularized, away from the monolithic structure of the past.

> ...These developers aren't building communities; they're directing air traffic ~ Nadia (page 13)

Nadia's commenting the maintainers have to balance the seesaw between making progress of their projects and the swath of people learning about said tool / needing help. The price of maintainers is their time.

They (users) at screaming at you, not for you for your time.

Open source was supposed to be collaborative, but it's become far from it.

### Thoughts on Introduction

Open Source in many instances is this one-to-many scenario where you can think at least in the web developer community, Kent C Dodds is synonomous with Testing, Dan Abramov is synonomous with React, and it goes to that even though there are tons of people making and creating things, we've entered a "consumption" world where there's always more users than creators.

Open Source touts "Oh anyone can submit issues or code contributions" but how accurate is that and how does that affect both someone coming into Open Source as well as the people managing the projects?
