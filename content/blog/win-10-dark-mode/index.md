As more operating systems gain the feature to have a "Dark Mode", a feature I enjoy is the ability to have the OS swap between light and dark themes based on the time of day. MacOS (and iOS) support this [natively out of the box](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-a-light-or-dark-appearance-mchl52e1c2d2/mac), and Windows 10 has a dark mode, but there is no auto-mode by default.

Armin2208 on GitHub wrote a Windows app called [Windows-Auto-Night-Mode](https://github.com/Armin2208/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode/) which can enable the functionality either based on the sunset / sunrise or specific time of day. Alongside, Windows 10 has the ability to enable dark mode for Apps or the System UI so rather than a global switch you can enable the theme for portions of the dekstop rather than everything at once.
